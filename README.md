# savionit-filtering


This product page contains many different colors and textures. My task was to create a "Filter All" button, then sort all the data by color and texture, and then when the user selects a color, the function filters all colors by that parameter. If the user also selects textures, it will show results that match both parameters. (This function can take up to 6 different parameters)
As you can see, we have a counter that shows users how many elements are left with the options already selected - this was the hardest part (><) But I did it! And now we can select multiple colors, multiple textures and see what's left.
